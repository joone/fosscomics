## About the Repository

This repository hosts the source code used to generate the static website for F/OSS Comics.

The static webpage generator was adapted from [kartiknair's blog](https://github.com/kartiknair/blog) and is styled using the [Archie theme](https://github.com/athul/archie). I've customized the generator to better suit the needs of the F/OSS Comics series.

## Contributions

I welcome contributions and feedback on the comics and the website. If you have suggestions or want to contribute, please submit a pull request or join the discusstions.
