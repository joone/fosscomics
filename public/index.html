Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, transitioning from the Multics project, aimed for simplicity and efficiency, developing Unix on PDP-7 and later porting it to PDP-11. The creation of the C language, evolving from B, allowed Unix to be rewritten in a high-level language, setting a foundational standard for modern computing and operating system development...</div>

This culture evolved into today's open-source hacker community, expanding with the advent of ARPAnet, the precursor to the internet... </div>

Mathematicians and scientists initially drove programming, evolving into early software engineering roles. Margaret Hamilton, who developed software for the Apollo 11 mission, played a key role in establishing software engineering as a serious discipline, amidst a backdrop where many programmers were women, reflecting the field's undervalued status at the time... </div>

ENIAC, for example, ran programs by manual rewiring. With the advent of stored-program computers like EDVAC and EDSAC, programming involved writing machine code, a binary language difficult for humans. Assembly language, using mnemonics for machine instructions, simplified the process. Programmers wrote code on paper, debugged it mentally, then transferred it to punch cards for execution, a tedious process that involved waiting for machine time and results...</div>
