                    <p>Until the 1960s, hardware was the main focus of computer engineering. Computers and peripheral devices were large machines that filled big rooms, they were costly and required manpower to operate. Unlike today, software back then was not a separate field of engineering or science</p>

      <div class="blockquote-container"><blockquote><p>“When you do math calculations on a newly introduced computer, you will get results quickly.”</p></blockquote></div><p>People who majored in science or engineering learned programming because they could do mathematical calculations and various experiments with computers that were previously done manually.  Some of them fell in love with programming and changed their jobs as programmers.</p>

Notably she observed that software development was not taken as seriously as engineering and was not even considered a science.</p><p>After studying mathematics in university, she began working as a programmer at MIT to support her husband&#39;s Ph.D. At that time, without any proper software development training, she joined in the development of a program to predict the weather.</p>

      <div class="blockquote-container"><blockquote><p>“At the time, computer science and software engineering were not part of the regular curriculum. So programmers had to work through hands-on experience.”</p></blockquote></div><p>Following this, she became a system programming expert and participated in the Apollo 11 mission. At the time, the Apollo 11 mission did not include any budget and schedule for software development, and there was no mention of software in the requirements<a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/10/margaret-hamilton-nasa-apollo/ "title="Her Code Got Humans on the Moon—And Invented Software Itself, wired.com">&lbrack;1&rbrack;</a> However, software was important enough to control the flight of the spacecraft and the lunar lander. Margaret took her daughter to the office on weekends to develop more reliable software.</p>

The reason is that at the time, software development was less important than hardware development, so women were mainly in charge, and they were also paid less than men<a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/computer-programming-used-to-be-womens-work-718061/ "title="Computer Programming Used To Be Women’s Work, Smithsonian Magazine">&lbrack;2&rbrack;</a>.
